<h1>Number 2</h1>
<h2>The first Diether Face.</h2>
 <p>While we are in discord turning on our cameras, We were having fun but then, Diether suddenly, made this face, It was a very hilarious experience but it is still scary</p>

<h1>Number 3</h1>
<h2>The second Rohanne Face.</h2>

<h1>Number 6</h1>
<h2>The second Diether Face.</h2>
 <p>The picture Diether took was the most funniest one in my opinion, It was just hilarious and is not creepy, Just look at the image yourself.</p>

<h1>Number 7</h1>
<h2>The fourth Rohanne Face.</h2>
 <p>As you can see in the picture, It appears to be in red (sorry marcus nakalimutan ko colorblind ka), In the picture you can see Rohanne literally staring at your soul, Ready to haunt you in your dreams.</p>

<h1>Number 8</h1>
<h2>The fifth Rohanne Face.</h2>
 <p>In the picture, Diether screenshotted what he saw, Rohanne was very close to the camera staring at him, This recently happened yesterday when I invited Rohanne to get in our discord call, We are opening our cameras again, And then she did the face.</p>

<h1>Number 9</h1>
<h2>The first Marcus Face.</h2>
 <p>Last time while we were in our discord call, Marcus tried to enter the scary face stuff, So i took this picture of him, It gives the vibe that you're about to get kidnapped by him because of that stare.</p>

<h1>Number 10</h1>
<h2>The second Keanne Face.</h2>
 <p>This picture was made in the same time when the first Marcus face was made, In the picture, It is much dark and it looks like the eyes is glowing.</p>
